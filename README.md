# Juntoo Tech Notes

I'm planning to keep a blog where I describe the technology behind
[Juntoo](https://juntoo.co). I want a statically generated blog that I
can just [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) to our static web site, and
for the moment I'm experimenting with
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/). We'll see how it goes - at
the moment I haven't published anything.
